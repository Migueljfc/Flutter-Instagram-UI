    'Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" (French for "Iron Lady"), it was constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the centerpiece of the 1889 World\'s Fair. Although initially criticised by some of France\'s leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world; 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015. It was designated a monument historique in 1964, and was named part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site ("Paris, Banks of the Seine") in 1991.',

    'The Arc de Triomphe is located on the right bank of the Seine at the centre of a dodecagonal configuration of twelve radiating avenues. It was commissioned in 1806, after the victory at Austerlitz by Emperor Napoleon at the peak of his fortunes. Laying the foundations alone took two years and, in 1810, when Napoleon entered Paris from the west with his new bride, Archduchess Marie-Louise of Austria, he had a wooden mock-up of the completed arch constructed. The architect, Jean Chalgrin, died in 1811 and the work was taken over by Jean-Nicolas Huyot.',

      'Several movies have been filmed on the bridge, including some scenes in the 1969 James Bond film On Her Majesty\'s Secret Service when James Bond is in a car driving across a bridge with Marc Ange Draco\'s henchmen, and it is also featured near the end of the movie when Bond marries Tracy and drives across the bridge with her in Bond\'s Aston Martin. Normally, pedestrians cannot walk across the bridge, but every year there is a half-marathon that starts on the south bank and finishes in the north bank (Belem).',
